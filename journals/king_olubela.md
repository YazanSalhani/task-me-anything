We practice the git process with the group with each student alternating. We also ensure that we knew the basis of how the models are set
up in the fastAPI system.

The Group and I took time creating the router and queries for the users table. Yazan, and Andrew as well as Arielle took turn with setting this up.

King's Contribution -
I was in charge of coding the router and the queries for the tasks table. We ended up having to debug and error that occured while getting the list all the tasks. An the end we were able to fix it closer to the end of the day.

WE all help code the restrictions that allows the user to change the status of the task. After three iterations we were able to get the code to begin working.  Then I helped with checking if the code actually worked.

- We mob-coded the comment table, and I was responsible for coding the list comment and create comment routes and queries. Additionally, I contributed to model editing.
- Initially, Andy led the mob coding session, where we successfully implemented two third-party API requests. Later, I took the lead in mob coding for creating and listing comments for specific tasks, focusing on coding the list comment and create comment routes and queries while also assisting with model editing.
- We encountered a bug while trying to join the tasks and comments tables for listing purposes. After consulting with our instructor, we learned that it was more RESTful to keep the tables separate, as comments already referenced their associated tasks. This allowed us to create two distinct components for the front end.
- Later on, I piloted the mob coding session, where we implemented the "get comment details" and "edit comment" functionalities, and collaboratively developed the comment table.

- Andy worked on the auth feature and the redux framework.

- We mob coded the path feature for feature set in the backend. We also setup some of the redux feature and Arielle was in charge of piloting the group through this.
