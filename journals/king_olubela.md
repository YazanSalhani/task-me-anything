## Journal Entry for 8/6/2024
We practiced the Git process as a group, with each student taking turns. We also ensured that we understood the basics of how models are set up in the FastAPI system.

## Journal Entry for 8/7/2024
We mob-coded the creation of our database tables and played a role in debugging errors that arose.

## Journal Entry for 8/8/2024
The group and I spent time creating the router and queries for the users table. Yazan, Andrew, and Arielle each took turns setting this up.
King's Contribution
I was responsible for coding the router and queries for the tasks table. We encountered an error while getting the list of all tasks, but by the end of the day, we were able to fix it.

## Journal Entry for 8/9/2024
We all contributed to coding the restrictions that allow users to change the status of a task. After three iterations, we got the code working, and I helped verify that it functioned correctly.

## Journal Entry for 8/13/2024
We mob-coded the comment table, and I was responsible for coding the list comment and create comment routes and queries. I also contributed to model editing.
Andy led the initial mob coding session, where we implemented two third-party API requests. Later, I took the lead in mob coding to create and list comments for specific tasks, focusing on the list comment and create comment routes and queries while also assisting with model editing.
We encountered a bug while trying to join the tasks and comments tables for listing purposes. After consulting with our instructor, we learned that it was more RESTful to keep the tables separate since comments already referenced their associated tasks. This allowed us to create two distinct components for the front end.
I later led a mob coding session where we implemented the "get comment details" and "edit comment" functionalities and collaboratively developed the comment table.

## Journal Entry for 8/14/2024
The group mob-coded with Yazan as the main pilot, setting up the delete component for the comments.
I led the testing of the app feature that Yazan implemented.
Andy worked on the auth feature and the Redux framework.

## Journal Entry for 8/15/2024
We mob-coded the path feature for the backend. We also set up some Redux features, with Arielle piloting the group through this.

## Journal Entry for 08/19/2024
Caught Andy up on the work from last week.
We encountered issues with the assignee and signer date.
We resolved the issue by creating a new route for the hook to try and fix it.

## Journal Entry for 08/20/2024
The day began with Yazan mob coding. He and Arielle found a solution to the issues we had displaying the names on the task page, successfully rectifying the errors.
In the afternoon, I took over and set up the routes for the signup page.
Andrew then took over to do the same for the signin page.
