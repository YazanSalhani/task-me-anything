## Journal Entry for 8/6/2024
```
We mob coded, forking the project repo and creating issues on gitlab. We each added our journal doc to the journals directory, and practiced pushing to the repo and merging as a group.

We also designed our database tables, and created a practice project with docker to test out the creation of the tables to make sure we knew it would work.

## Journal Entry for 8/7/2024
```
Today we mob coded, and Yazan, Andy, and I took turns leading. We worked together to create new migration files, so that we could do a customized User table that included more data. We also created tables for Tasks and Comments.

We needed to make sure that the new User data was reflected in our User pydantic models (and our queries and routes), so we read through each to determine what needed to be adjusted.

After making adjustments, we tested that we are able to create new users, sign in, and sign out.
